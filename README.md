# MOAS Docs

An Omeka plugin to store MOAS documentation natively in every distribution.

The documentation is split in to three sections:

* **Config:** How to configure Omeka ahead of content being added.
* **Content:** How to add and edit the actual content of the site.
* **Troubleshooting:** Steps to resolve potential issues that may not be covered in the config.

To add to or edit content, update the appropriate markdown file in the `docs` folder.
