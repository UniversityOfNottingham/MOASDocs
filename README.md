# MOAS Docs

An Omeka plugin to store MOAS documentation natively in every distribution.

The documentation is split in to two sections:

* **Content:** How to add and edit the actual contents of the site
* **Config:** How to configure Omeka ahead of content being added.

To add to or edit content, update the appropriate markdown file in the `docs` folder. The plugin will parse this into HTML.

For now, anything in the documentaion that needs to be reviewed or clarified should be wrapped in `<mark>` tags.
