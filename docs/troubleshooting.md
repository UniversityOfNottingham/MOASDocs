### Nothing appears in my search results

* This may be the result of the site content being cloned rather than added via a bulk upload or manual entry. Clicking [Clear and Reindex](/solr-search/reindex) (and waiting a few minutes for the process to finish) should solve this.


### The theme appearance options don't seem to be working

* If this is a new archive that has just been created, the theme options probably just need to be saved to push the default values into the database.
* Some theme options contradict others, so ensure that you don't have settings that override others.
* Read the description of the option carefully - some checkboxes enable features while others disable.
